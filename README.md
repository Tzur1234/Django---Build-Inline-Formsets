# Django---Build-Inline-Formsets

In this project I was building A Python Django app, using Class-based views and inline formsets. In this example I use TemplateView, ListView, CreateView, DetailView, FormView. 
SingleObjectMixin, FormView overrides get/post/get_form to build a work example whereby with Inline Formsets work with 2 models data to update, delete, save from a single form
